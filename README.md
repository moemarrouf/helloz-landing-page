# Helloz Messaging app 
> it's better than any Meta app btw.

This is a task from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and I designed my own UI to complete the task. You can find the full image of the UI design in the Design Directory. 

<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://embed.figma.com/proto/LmtC82JuPxzBY5qacYlfni/Daily-UI?node-id=11-4&p=f&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=11%3A2&starting-point-node-id=11%3A4&embed-host=share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

## Features 
- Cool design since I'm the best UI Designer ever lived and will ever live.
- Full dark mode design.
- Kinda responsive design (I'm still a noob at CSS).
- Sticky header (I'don't know I'm out of features).

**feel free to take the whole project and edit it, burn it down, call it names or anything it's up to you bro.**
